# Multiplayer-Demo

Welcome to my repository of the Multiplayer Demo Game, a personal project I developed using Unity and Photon. This game is a demonstration of the potential of multiplayer co-op games, with a focus on room management and character control.
Main features:

## Room Creation and Access.
Players can create a custom room or join an existing one through a code, allowing easy multiplayer access.
Three Dynamic Scenes:
<ul>
 <li>Loading Scene: Connection to the Photon server.</li>
 <li>Lobby Scene: Here players can decide whether to create a new room or access it by entering a name.</li>
 <li>Game Scene: Featuring a 2D character controller that allows movement in all directions.</li>
</ul>

## Exclusive Character Control.
Only the room creator can move the main character, while participants have supporting roles with different visual perspectives.
 Multi-Camera View: Each player has a unique view, enhancing the shared game experience.
 Multi-Platform Support: The game is designed to run smoothly on multiple platforms, ensuring broad and inclusive connectivity.

### Technologies Used:

<ul>
 <li>Unity: For interactive scenario development and gameplay management.</li>
 <li>Photon Unity Networking (PUN): Manages multiplayer interactions and synchronization of game sessions.</li>
</ul>
